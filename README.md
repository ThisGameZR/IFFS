# IFFS

IFFS is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of collecting and analyzing customer feedback. Our solution aims to help website owners easily see the critical level of the problems reported by their users, prioritize which problems should be fixed first, and monitor the overall feedback trend on their website pages. Our system categorizes feedback into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral, providing an in-depth analysis of user satisfaction levels. With IFFS, website owners can make informed decisions to improve their website and enhance the user experience.
